"""
Form mode elicitation: a tool asking the user a question.

MCP version 2026-07-28 has no server-to-client requests, so a tool that needs
input returns an input_required result, and the client answers by retrying the
whole call. The answers so far travel in requestState, which arrives through
the client, so it is signed and bound to the caller, the tool, and the call's
arguments.
