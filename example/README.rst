Example Application: MCPizza
============================

An example project serving a local MCP server for a pizza place called **MCPizza** (not to be confused with `McPizza <https://mcdonalds.fandom.com/wiki/McPizza>`__).

The example is intended to show how to build an MCP server and a use case that allows an LLM to make decisions based on freeform text in a database.
Each ``Pizza`` has structured fields the server can filter and enforce, such as price and the dates a special runs between, as well as freeform ``notes`` that an LLM can act on, such as “Vegan cheese available on request”.

The important code lives in these files:

* ``pizzeria/models.py``: the models.
* ``pizzeria/migrations/0002_menu.py``: the migration that seeds data.
  Specials are dated relative to the day you run the migrations.
* ``pizzeria/mcp.py``: the MCP server and tools.
* ``pizzeria/views.py`` and ``pizzeria/templates/pizzeria/menu.html``: the menu web page that the ``menu_link`` tool points at.
* ``pizzeria/static/pizzeria/icon.svg``: the server’s icon, which clients show alongside its title.

The seven tools are:

* ``current_date``: today’s date and weekday, so an LLM can work out what relative dates like “tomorrow” mean.
* ``search_menu``: the pizzas available on a date, with an optional name query and price limit, returning the notes for the model to read.
* ``place_order``: order a pizza from today’s menu, with a ``requests`` field for whatever the model gleaned from the notes.
  The server enforces the menu, rejecting pizzas not available today with an in-band error the model can act on.
* ``orders_chart``: a pie chart of the pizzas ordered today, as a PNG image drawn with `Pillow <https://pypi.org/project/pillow/>`__, with the numbers behind it as text.
  The text is there so the model can answer from it in clients that do not show it images.
* ``menu_link``: a link to the menu web page for a date, past or future, for the user to open in a browser.
* ``add_to_menu``: add a pizza to the menu, asking the user for its price, whether it’s vegetarian, and any notes, with `elicitation <https://django-mcpz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/servers.html#asking-the-user-a-question>`__.
* ``remove_from_menu``: take a pizza off the menu from tomorrow, once the user confirms, also with elicitation.
  It’s retired rather than deleted, since orders refer to it.

The last two need a client that supports form mode elicitation on the 2026-07-28 protocol, such as the Python SDK below.
Other clients get an in-band error saying they can’t answer the question.

Setup
-----

In this directory, run:

.. code-block:: sh

    uv run --group example manage.py migrate
    uv run --group example manage.py runserver

The ``example`` dependency group adds Pillow, for the chart.
Migrating creates an SQLite database seeded with the menu.
The ``runserver`` should launch the MCP server at http://127.0.0.1:8066/mcp, with the menu web page at http://127.0.0.1:8066/menu/2026-01-01/ for any date.

This example is unauthenticated (``auth=public``) and served on localhost only, as it’s a local demo, not something to expose to a network.
See the `authentication docs <https://django-mcpz.readthedocs.io/en/latest/servers.html#authentication>`__ for adding auth.

Once the server is running, any MCP client should be able to connect.

Test with ``llm``
-----------------

`llm <https://pypi.org/project/llm/>`__ is a command-line interface for LLMs that supports MCP.
Set it up with an appropriate plugin for your model of choice and use the `llm-tools-mcp <https://pypi.org/project/llm-tools-mcp/>`__ plugin to connect to the MCPizza server.

For example, using Claude, running llm through `uvx <https://docs.astral.sh/uv/guides/tools/>`__:

.. code-block:: console

    $ LLM_TOOLS_MCP_CONFIG_DIR=. \
      uvx --with llm-anthropic --with llm-tools-mcp --with "mcp<2" \
      llm -m claude-sonnet-5 -T MCP \
      "Order me a mix of pizzas to feed up to 70 attendees at Django London."

Note:

* ``LLM_TOOLS_MCP_CONFIG_DIR=.`` points llm-tools-mcp at this directory, so it picks up the ``mcp.json`` file describing the server.

* `llm-anthropic <https://pypi.org/project/llm-anthropic/>`__ is an ``llm`` plugin to connect to Claude.

* `llm-tools-mcp <https://pypi.org/project/llm-tools-mcp/>`__ is an ``llm`` plugin to connect to MCP servers.

* ``mcp<2`` is a temporary workaround to paper over llm-tools-mcp’s lack of support for the new version at time of writing.

* ``-m claude-sonnet-5`` selects the model to use.

* ``-T MCP`` tells llm to use the MCP plugin, which is required for tool calls.

Adapt the command for your model of choice.

Here’s an example run (with thinking traces omitted):

.. code-block:: text

    I should check today's date first, then look at the menu options to plan a pizza order for 70 people.

    ...

    Done! Ordered **24 pizzas** for Django London (≈70 attendees, ~2.7 slices/person):

    | Pizza | Qty | Notes | Total |
    |---|---|---|---|
    | Margherita of Theseus | 5 | 2 with vegan cheese | £47.50 |
    | Four Cheese, Five If You're Nice | 3 | — | £36.00 |
    | The Off-By-One | 3 | 1 with vegan cheese | £31.50 |
    | Pepperoni Overflow | 4 | — | £50.00 |
    | The Hawaiian Standoff | 2 | — | £22.00 |
    | Nduja Believe It | 2 | Spicy | £26.00 |
    | Null Pointer | 2 | 1 gluten-free | £12.00 |
    | Garlic Bread (Technically a Pizza) | 3 | 1 gluten-free | £16.50 |

    **Grand total: £241.50**

    Mix covers: vegetarian majority, vegan-cheese options, a gluten-free base or two, classic pepperoni/Hawaiian for meat-eaters, and a spicy nduja option — should keep a diverse Django meetup crowd happy. Let me know if you'd like to adjust quantities or add anything (e.g., more spicy/vegan coverage).

Add ``--td`` to the command to enable tool debugging, which prints the model’s tool calls and the server’s responses among the output, like:

.. code-block:: text

    Tool call: place_order({'pizza': 'Margherita of Theseus', 'quantity': 5, 'requests': '2 with vegan cheese please, rest standard'})
      [TextContent(type='text', text='{"order_id":3,"pizza":"Margherita of Theseus","quantity":5,"requests":"2 with vegan cheese please, rest standard","total":47.5}', annotations=None, meta=None)]

Once some orders exist, try the chart and the menu link:

.. code-block:: console

    $ LLM_TOOLS_MCP_CONFIG_DIR=. \
      uvx --with llm-anthropic --with llm-tools-mcp --with "mcp<2" \
      llm -m claude-sonnet-5 -T MCP --td \
      "Which pizza is most popular today? Then give me a link to tomorrow's menu."

.. TODO: paste example output.

Test with ``claude``
--------------------

If you have `Claude Code <https://claude.com/claude-code>`__ set up, you can test with its CLI too.
Run:

.. code-block:: sh

    claude --mcp-config mcp.json --strict-mcp-config --allowedTools "mcp__mcpizza__*" \
      -p "What vegetarian pizzas could I order tomorrow for under \$12? I'd prefer vegan if they can do it."

Note:

* ``--mcp-config mcp.json`` points the model at the ``mcp.json`` file in this directory that describes the server.

* ``--strict-mcp-config`` tells the model to reject any server that doesn’t match the config exactly.

* ``--allowedTools "mcp__mcpizza__*"`` restricts the model to only the tools in this server, so it can’t call other tools on other servers.

Here’s an example answer from a model, after it called the ``current_date`` and ``search_menu`` MCP tools:

.. code-block:: text

    For tomorrow (2026-09-04), the vegetarian options under $12 are:

    - **Null Pointer** – $6 — plain base, vegan by default (no cheese/toppings)
    - **Garlic Bread (Technically a Pizza)** – $5.50 — vegetarian; GF base available, but not noted as vegan-adaptable
    - **Margherita of Theseus** – $9.50 — vegetarian, **vegan cheese available on request**
    - **The Off-By-One** (mushrooms, olives, red onion) – $10.50 — vegetarian, **vegan cheese available on request**

    Since you'd prefer vegan: **Margherita of Theseus** or **The Off-By-One** both work with vegan cheese swapped in, and **Null Pointer** is vegan as-is (though it's just a plain base). Want me to place an order for one of these?

Write tools work too.
This creates a real ``Order`` row, with the model’s reading of the notes in its ``requests`` field:

.. code-block:: sh

    claude --mcp-config mcp.json --strict-mcp-config --allowedTools "mcp__mcpizza__*" \
      -p "I'm gluten-free. Order me two of whatever you'd recommend from today's menu and make sure the kitchen knows about the base. Tell me the order ID and total."

Example output:

.. code-block:: text

    Order placed: **2× Garlic Bread (Technically a Pizza)** on gluten-free bases (kitchen note included explicitly).

    - **Order ID:** 1
    - **Total:** $11.00

The ``orders_chart`` tool returns an image alongside text.
Claude Code shows PNG images to the model, so it can describe the chart itself, colours included:

.. code-block:: sh

    claude --mcp-config mcp.json --strict-mcp-config --allowedTools "mcp__mcpizza__*" \
      -p "Fetch today's orders chart, describe what the image shows, and say which pizza is most popular."

Example output:

.. code-block:: text

    Today's chart (2026-09-11) is a pie chart showing 11 total pizzas ordered, split four ways: Margherita of Theseus (5, 45%, blue), Pepperoni Overflow (3, 27%, orange), The Off-By-One (2, 18%, green), and Null Pointer (1, 9%, yellow).

    **Margherita of Theseus** is the most popular pizza today, with nearly half of all orders.

The ``menu_link`` tool returns a resource link, which the model passes on as a URL:

.. code-block:: sh

    claude --mcp-config mcp.json --strict-mcp-config --allowedTools "mcp__mcpizza__*" \
      -p "Give me a link to tomorrow's menu."

Example output:

.. code-block:: text

    Here's tomorrow's menu (2026-09-12): http://127.0.0.1:8066/menu/2026-09-12/

Talking to it from Python
-------------------------

The official `MCP Python SDK <https://pypi.org/project/mcp/>`__ (version 2+) can connect like so:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio

    from mcp.client.client import Client


    async def main():
        async with Client("http://127.0.0.1:8066/mcp") as client:
            tools = await client.list_tools()
            print([tool.name for tool in tools.tools])
            result = await client.call_tool("search_menu", {"max_price": 10})
            print(result.structured_content)
            result = await client.call_tool("orders_chart", {})
            for block in result.content:
                print(type(block).__name__, getattr(block, "mime_type", None) or block.text)
            result = await client.call_tool("menu_link", {"on_date": "2026-12-25"})
            print(result.content[0].uri)


    asyncio.run(main())

The chart comes back as a ``TextContent`` and an ``ImageContent`` block, whose ``data`` is the base64-encoded PNG, and the link as a ``ResourceLink``:

.. code-block:: text

    ['current_date', 'search_menu', 'place_order', 'add_to_menu', 'remove_from_menu', 'orders_chart', 'menu_link']
    {'date': '2026-09-11', 'pizzas': [{'name': 'Garlic Bread (Technically a Pizza)', ...}, ...]}
    TextContent Pizzas ordered on 2026-09-11, 11 in total: Margherita of Theseus 5 (45%), Pepperoni Overflow 3 (27%), The Off-By-One 2 (18%), Null Pointer 1 (9%).
    ImageContent image/png
    http://127.0.0.1:8066/menu/2026-12-25/

To answer the questions ``add_to_menu`` and ``remove_from_menu`` ask, pass the client an ``elicitation_callback``.
This one prompts in the terminal, standing in for the accept and decline buttons a client would show:

.. code-block:: python

    import asyncio

    from mcp.client.client import Client
    from mcp_types import ElicitResult


    async def answer(context, params):
        print(params.message)
        if input("Accept or decline? (a/d): ") != "a":
            return ElicitResult(action="decline")
        content = {}
        for name, field in params.requested_schema["properties"].items():
            value = input(f"{field['description']} ({field['type']}): ")
            if field["type"] == "boolean":
                content[name] = value.lower().startswith("y")
            elif field["type"] == "number":
                content[name] = float(value)
            else:
                content[name] = value
        return ElicitResult(action="accept", content=content)


    async def main():
        async with Client(
            "http://127.0.0.1:8066/mcp", elicitation_callback=answer
        ) as client:
            result = await client.call_tool(
                "add_to_menu",
                {
                    "name": "Segfault Supreme",
                    "description": "Tomato, mozzarella, chilli oil.",
                },
            )
            print(result.structured_content or result.content[0].text)
            result = await client.call_tool(
                "remove_from_menu", {"pizza": "Segfault Supreme"}
            )
            print(result.structured_content or result.content[0].text)


    asyncio.run(main())

Each call runs twice: once to ask the question, then again, repeated by the client, with the answer.
